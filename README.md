- The project starts with a house charged.

- Configuration window were you can configurate the window, see the mouse information, the fps, and hardware information.
- Console window that prints libraries initialitzation and information of game objects loading.

## Resource Manager

- Creates a .meta for every model droped on the scene (doesn't duplicate).
- Creates a copy of the dragged and droped outerfiles.
- Creates a folder called Library. In this folder there are stored our custom format meshes (.pry).
- If a model is already loaded, doesen't import used stored meshes.
- If a model has cff and .meta, doesn't import the model, instead, loads the already saved meshes.
- The components use less memory as they reuse the same resorces loaded in the project.
